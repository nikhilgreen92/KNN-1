# KNN-1
The data set of credit card customers is available with various inputs. Since the incoming dataset is split into two i.e. dependent and independent variable thus we had used merge to join both the data sets in a common data frame.
Information of all sets of columns has been derived using basic commands info, head, null values, count values etc. The null values available have been cleaned. Later EDA has been incorporated to extract the desired information out of given data. In the later part of processing we have now encoded the categorical variables and applied train test split. Finally the model has been evaluated after hypertuning and conculsion has been given. The conclusion derived is : The model finally can predict 92.22% times the correct accuracy if the person will happen to take credit card on not. While 7.78% times the model is unable to predict. We have achieved a better precision with high accuracy thus model can be used for future aspirations. Although accuracy is higher, a more better hypertuning can further increase the accuracy.
